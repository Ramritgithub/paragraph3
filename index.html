         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations are often seeking techniques for improving the actions to
structure decision models. However, with the possible exception of routine and
well-structured problems, most of the decision problems found in organizations
constitute a chaotic and complex family of problems. The principle of bounded
rationality proposed by Herbert Simon suggests the use of a decision model
based on a simplified model of a firm with a small number of relational concepts,
such as: (a) quasi resolution of conflict,( b) uncertainty avoidance or minimization, (c) search directed around the main objective of the problem and, (d)
adaptation of organizational goals based on learning.Organizations achieve a better decision-making process by searching different
levels of knowledge inside and outside the organization. According to March
(1999), the pursuit of organizational knowledge (or intelligence) to structure
better decision models is made particularly difficult by three problems. The first
     problem is the problem ofignorance, because not every thing is known, the<p></div><br>
      <div class="first">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future is uncertain, and so on. The second problem is the problem of conflict,
because organizations seek goals and objectives in the name of multiple, nested
actors over multiple, nested time periods. The third problem is the problem of
ambiguity, caused by ill-defined or ill-measured preferences and identities.
In order to arrive at good procedures for a decision-making process, organizations adopt some practices leading to intelligent actions. For example, the
“rule-based rational action” is considered an intelligent action to estimate the
future consequences of possible current actions and choose the one with the
highest expected value. Procedures based on “rule-based action,” used
together with “organizational learning,” are considered by many authors, as a
way to involve assessments of the collective actions and long-term consequences rather than individual action at a particular time.<p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; However, neither “rationality” nor “learning” always assures a reasonable final
model. In Chapter IX, <i>a list of problems considered to be the hidden traps in
decision making — the anchoring trap, the status-quo trap, the sunk-cost
          trap, the confirming-evidence trap, </i>ithe framing trap, and estimating and
forecasting traps — is presented. <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;istics observed in strategic decision problems are: medium to long-range semistructured or nonstructured problems with complexity.
Complexity in the decision-making process is related to one or more of the
following features<p> trap, the confirming-evidence trap, ithe framing trap, and estimating and
forecasting traps
      
     
     &nbsp;&nbsp;  According to the authors of this list,
complex and important decisions problems are the most prone to distortion
because they tend to involve assumptions, estimates, and the inputs from the
          most people (Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Matheus et al., 1993; March, 1999). 
         
          <p class="b">The Framework for Strategic<br>
Decision-Making</p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          In Chapter VIII, a decision problem was presented by three levels of decision:
(1) strategic decisions — which refer to the long-range goals and the policies
for resource allocation; (2) tactical decisions — referring to the acquisition and
efficient utilization of resources in the accomplishment of organizational goals;
and (3) operational decisions — concerning the efficient and effective execution of specific tasks. In that chapter, we have noted that the main character-
         <br><br></div><br>
          
<div class="first">
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Uncertainty.</b> In the evaluation of alternatives of action, eventual outcomes are not known for certain but only in a probabilistic level depending
on subjective judgments of experts.<p></p>
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Multiple variables or attributes.</b> In many real-world problems, the use
of traditional mathematical algorithms such as nonlinear programming,
scheduling algorithm, queuing algorithms, etc., become prohibitive when
a problem with large number of variables or attributes must be considered.
These problems, known as NP (Non Polynomial) complex problems,
may often require the use of sophisticated meta-heuristics or Artificial
Intelligence algorithms.<p></p>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Multiple objectives.</b> One of the main impacts of the decision-making
process has been to provide a useful description to deal with alternatives
whose outcomes have multiple, often conflicting objectives or goals.<p></p>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Multiple alternatives. </b>The development of reliable procedures to
eliminate dominated alternatives — that alternative already included
inside another alternative — is an important part of the decision-making
process to simplify the problem. But how can we obtain powerful
simplifications without the risk of missing crucial points through oversimplification?<p></p>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sequence of decisions.</b> Many decision problems are multiple-stage
problems in which a dependent or independent decision is taken at each
stage and associated with the evaluation of the use of new information at
particular moments in the sequence of decision-making.<p></p>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> Imprecise or fuzzy problems.</B> Problems difficult to be defined precisely
— due to the large dimensionality or the qualitative nature of their
attributes and/or relationships — require the application of new types of
algorithms such as expert systems, fuzzy algorithms, neural nets, and soon.<br><br>
    The environments in which management must operate today are more complex
today than ever before, and the trend is toward increasing complexity. Majorfactors such as new technologies, global markets, competition, political stability, etc., are facing more and more the effects of increasing trends that results
in more alternatives to choose, larger costs of making errors, and more
uncertainty regarding the future. <p></p>Decision-making today is more complicated
than in the past. However, the benefits of well-structured and implemented
strategic decision making are very large.
As a result of these trends and changes, it is very difficult to rely on a trial-anderror approach to management, especially in decisions involving the factors
mentioned above. Managers must learn how to use new tools and techniques
    that are being developed in their field.</div><br>

<div class="first">
    Today, an organization is not interested only in the best alternative of decision
(for instance, the alternative that provides highest profit), but it is interested in
knowing a set of good enough or best possible alternatives considering multiple
criteria such as quality aspects, labor benefits, environmental risk, and so on.
Therefore it is often necessary to analyze each alternative in light of its potential
impact on several goals. In mathematical methods used to handle multiple goals
(such as Utility Theory, Goal Programming, Multiple Objective Linear Programming), it is usually difficult to obtain an explicit statement of the organization’s
goals because the relationship between alternatives and their impact on goals
may be difficult to quantify. To understand complex models and to enable
flexibility and adaptation to changing conditions for different decision-making
situations, the procedure of sensitivity analysis adopted by software of
Decision Support System (DSS), Expert System (ES), and Artificial Intelligence (Nilsson, 1970; Nilsson, 1998) techniques, is recommended.

        <p class="b">Exploiting Solutions Using<br>
            Expert Systems </p> 
    <div class="line"></div>
          
   Seeking out and refining solutions to problems formulated by mathematical
models, such as linear programming or dynamic programming, is neither
efficient nor sufficient to obtain new knowledge about problems in the real
world. Heuristic techniques are appropriate for obtaining near-optimal solutions in complex problems. Nevertheless, the solutions obtained by simple
heuristic methods need to be improved through the procedure known as metaheuristic techniques (Cook & Russel, 1993; Hillier & Liebermann, 1980) <p>
    Some of the better known meta-heuristic techniques are: simulated annealing,
tabu search, genetic algorithm, neural network, and so on (Turban & Arsonson,
1998; Takefuji ,1996).<p>An Artificial intelligence technique known as expert systems is recommended
for solving complex problems from the real world, which takes into consideration inferences with qualitative as well as quantitative variables. In the section
titled Application of an expert system, there is an example that illustrates the
application of the expert system in a simple problem involving two conflicting
criteria.</p>
    <p class="e">Application of an Expert System</p>
    <div class="line1"></div>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The expert system is an information system (file or database managed by a
computer program) which contains data or descriptive sentences about a given
branch of activity such as medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, financial
forecasts, machine design, consultations on geography, archeology, tourism,
language, etc. The information existing in the expert system was collected and
organized under the supervision of a group of experts on the subject. The
system can answer questions formulated by users, as if he or she were
consulting an expert person in the area.
Information is stored in the form of sentences called production or decision
rule of the following type:,</div><br>
      <div class="first">
   &nbsp;&nbsp; If { facts are true } then { execute algorithm A } else { execute
algorithm B}
forming a KNOWLEDGE DATABASE. These sentences are chosen
to resolve a problem, using software known as XINFERENCE MECHANISM.<p>
<i>Example: Selecting Companies Using Two Criteria (adapted from
Negoita,1985)</i><p>
          
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  1. Creating a degree with a consistent list of course offerings and
requirements on which colleges could mutually agree. All of the
colleges offered all of the courses that would be part of the online
Associate of Applied Science in Business. However, for some colleges the new online degree required giving up one or two courses
from their current business degrees. For other colleges, the new
online degree obligated them to accept new courses that were not
required in their current business degrees.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Creating an equitable financial model. From the beginning, CECC,
managing CCCOnline on behalf of the consortium, was intended to be
mainly self-supporting. The model had to allow for a management fee to
support CECC and create enough new state general fund support and
tuition funds for member colleges.</p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The CECC management team put in long, intense days during the first
two months of operation. The management team strived to meet the goals of
the program and simultaneously respond to implementation challenges.
There were two program goals:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;1. To eliminate redundancy of online offerings.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;2. To expand educational offerings to rural students.<br>
 Many community colleges, especially in the Denver metropolitan area,
were already offering online courses. In the year prior to the creation of
CCCOnline, these colleges became aware that they could no longer control
a service area marked by geographic boundaries. Therefore, these colleges
could not depend on students residing in the college service areas to continue
to fulfill their educational requirements at the local community college.
      Also,
the colleges duplicated other colleges’ online course offerings, and CC of C
believed that this duplication was an inefficient use of the hardware, software,
    personnel, and financial resources of the individual colleges.

       <div class="first">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<p>To classify companies according to the value of Sales and Profit, an expert
system can use a decision rule based on quantitative values:<br>“SELECT COMPANIES WITH SALES > $1000 and PROFIT >
14%”
           <img src="Screenshot%202024-02-07%20214530.png">    
           By this quantitative criterion, companies with excellent results (company C with
SALES = $900 and PROFIT = 18% and company F with SALES = $1200 and
PROFIT = 13%, were not selected.

          <br><p class="b">Fuzzy Expert System</p>
           <div class="line1"></div>
          We can have a more meaningful result if we attribute fuzzy values to the
variables SALES as well as PROFIT. Attributing three fuzzy values (low,
medium, high) to SALES and two fuzzy values (Acceptable, Not Acceptable)
to PROFIT, we have the following 3 2 = 6 rules of decision:<p>R1: If SALES = Low and PROFIT = Not Acceptable then DECISION = Not
select.<br>
R2: If SALES = Low and PROFIT = Acceptable then DECISION = Not
select.R3: If SALES = Medium and PROFIT = Not Acceptable then DECISION
= Not select.<br>
R4: If SALES= Medium and PROFIT = Acceptable then DECISION =
Select.<br>
R5: If SALES = High and PROFIT = Not Acceptable then DECISION = Not
select.<br>
R6: If SALES = High and PROFIT = Acceptable then DECISION = Select.<p>Using fuzzy inference it is possible to obtain a fuzzy classification based on a
fuzzy index:
</p>
           <img src="Screenshot%202024-02-07%20214552.png"><p>
           The values of the index can vary depending on the membership function
attributed to the fuzzy values. This example illustrates that the use of fuzzy values
and operations allow the manipulation and ordering of data with multiple
criteria.</div><br>
      <div class="first">
      <br><p class="b">Decision Support Systems (DSS)</p>
          <div class="line1"></div>
      Traditionally, most organizations make a decision based on successful past
experiences, that is, they are refining an already known procedure. Decision
alternatives are formulated and selected by quantitative methods of Operations
Research, and qualitative methods employing techniques of Artificial Intelligence, formulated by expert systems and fuzzy inference. This attitude corresponds to a search for organization intelligence using a refinement procedure.
Refinement means improving, regulating, producing, and recording existing
knowledge. It involves choice, efficiency, and reliability. It normally leads to an
improvement, but it can be blind to the search for new solutions.
The definitions of a DSS, according to different authors (Turban & Aronson,
1998; Cook & Russel, 1993, Li & Ye, 1990; Mallach, 2000) are
      
      <div class="pic">302 Shimizu, de Carvalho and Laurindo</div><p>
      <i>A DDS is a set of procedures (software programs) based on a dataprocessing environment to analyze problems with the aim to assist
managers in making decisions. The problems resolved by a DSS
can be of a structured, semi-structured, or nonstructured type,
according to the point of view of the people making decisions. A
DSS is a flexible and expansive system, capable of giving support
and providing ad hoc analysis of data and decision models, in the
search to obtain efficient results in long, mid and short-term
planning.<br>
      A DSS is a computer system made up of three interactive components:
a. a system of language (that allows communication among users and
the DSS sub systems;<br>
b. a system of knowledge (that stores available data, procedures and
intelligent information);<br>
c. a system for processing problems (structuring and executing appropriate models to solve problems); and<br>
d. a system that allows the sensibility analysis of the result of decision,<br>
providing a response to the “what-if?” question, such as question of
the type “what would happen to this result if the data utilized were
30% greater?”
</i><br>
          <p class="e">Reasons for Using a DSS</p>
          <div class="line1"></div>
          According to Turban and Aronson (1998), in an article published inComputer
World (September, 27, 1982), the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co listed the
following reasons for using a DSS:<p>
          • the company was facing growing competition in the country and abroad;<p>
• the company was having increasingly greater difficulty in monitoring its
numerous business operations;<p>
• the Information Systems department was not managing to meet the
company’s diversity of needs or to answer ad hoc questions raised by the
managers.</p>According to the same source, a study done in 1983 identified main reasons that
          organizations began using large scale DSS:<p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
One important reason mentioned for the development and use of a DSS is the
facility provided to end users. The end users are neither programmers nor
people trained in computers and they demand friendly tools and procedures for
easy use.
A DSS should have the following features, according to Turban and Aronson
(1998), and Mallach (2000)<p>
     1. serve managers at different levels;<p>
2. allow decisions by an individual or group;<p>
3. be able to make both sequential and interdependent decisions;<p>
4. provide a variety of decision making styles;</p>
5. be user friendly;<p>
6. seek efficacy and not efficiency;<p>
7. facilitate the formulation of the problem by the end user; and<p>
8. allow the analysis of results.<br>     
        
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DSS is intended to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process, to
provide better administrative control and to facilitate communication. It allows
for the analysis of existing alternatives, the optimizing alternatives and other
combinations of decision alternatives. However, it is very difficult to have a
DSS available at a low cost for nontraditional and nonstructured problems. The
diversity and complexity of the decision-making process makes it hard to
obtain an efficient and low cost DSS.<br>
      
       &nbsp;&nbsp;    The sensitivity analysis made by in a DSS, by asking questions of “what – if?”
type, has limited capacity in exploring for new facts, because the exploration
is restricted to the area around an existing solution.<p>
A DSS is a useful and efficient tool to foresee, generate, and evaluate the
alternatives for solving administrative problems.</p></div><br>

      <div class="first"><p>
          <p class="e">DSS Software Tools<p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          DSS contains standard software packages to help make decisions developed
for some specific problems. These packages are made available for public use
because: a) many people make these decisions, so the potential market is large;
and b) the decisions factors and objectives are the same for all of them, allowing
the use of standard algorithms or chart representation. The following packages
of software are usually available in a DSS:<p>
 1. Database management packages;<br>
2. Query and information retrieval packages;<br>
3. Statistical data analysis packages;<br>
4. Forecasting packages; and<br>
5. Graphing packages.<br>
          <div class="e">Using the Forecasting Package</div><p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          In the section titled Strategy and Decisions in Perspective, an illustrative case
for the use of a Forecasting package is presented. In this section a brief
description of the use of forecasting method is also presented. Different
methods of forecasting and their uses are described in a DSS software tool.
There is no universal forecasting method for all situations and circumstances.
A simple way to classify the problems that require forecasting is in terms of
functional areas to which they relate. One of the reasons for this classification
is that forecasting is merely a means for improving decision making and is not
an end in itself. Since decision-making problems and processes are often
grouped along a functional line (marketing, finance, or production), the
integrative aspect of existing forecasting methods is important in the medium
and short-term planning. Although each of the functional areas of business has<p>
          its own requirements for forecasts, a number of forecasts relates these
functional areas and are important in the overall decision-making framework of
the company.
It is possible to develop and use a single method of forecasting for a number of
different situations. First, all these situations deals with the future and time is
directly involved. Second, uncertainty is always present in forecasting situations. The third situation is that a forecast uses information contained in
historical data
          </p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          Two types of forecasting methods can be considered: qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods rely on managerial judgment without the
use of specific models. Qualitative methods are useful when there is a lack of
data or when past data are not reliable predictors of the future. Individual or
group decision makers can utilize the best available data and a qualitative
approach to arrive at a forecast. Examples of qualitative forecasting method
are: Delphi technique and market surveys. In chapter 13, a case study working
with qualitative methods (Delphi or NGT — Nominal Group Technique) in a
GDSS (Group Decision Support System) environment will be presented.<p>
There are two types of quantitative forecasting methods: time-series and causal
forecasting. Quantitative methods has gained wide acceptance for at least three
reasons: a) manager’s confidence on the record of past historical data; b) the
adoption of computers (the forecasting package is one of the useful software
tools in a DSS); and c) quantitative forecasts are much cheaper to obtain than
any of the available alternatives.<p>
Quantitative forecasting methods are used in a line of functions areas serving as
an input for decisions on process design, capacity planning and inventory. Time
Series forecasting methods, such as moving averages, exponential smoothing,
or Box-Jenkins methods, are used for short to medium-range planning, but the
integrative use in a line of functional areas makes quantitative forecasting
methods useful also for long-germ strategic decision planning. For instance,
information from a single forecast may be used simultaneously by marketing,
production, finance, and accounting, and even by the personnel department
helping in the decision of planning for the number of workers in each category
to be hired and trained.<p>
Time-series forecasting methods, considered as having a high level of accuracy
and used mostly for short and medium-range planning, may assume strategic
importance, for instance, when the marketing and operations departments
discuss the upcoming budgeting cycle. Time-series forecasting methods offer
a fast response in forecasting software available in most DSS systems.<p>Causal forecasting methods are used for medium to long-term range planning
of aggregate production inventory, sales by product classes, or countrywide
sales by industrial sectors. Causal forecasting methods using econometric
models or simulation models are recommended for long-term forecasting,
because of the cost involved and difficulty of working with them.

<p class="b">Some Cautions About the Use of Time-Series
Forecasting Methods<p><div class="line"></div>
      To illustrate the basic caution to be observed in the use of a time-series
forecasting package, let us consider past data of the demand for two products.
Product A presented an increasing and almost linear past demand, while past
demand for product B presented an irregular shape, as shown by following
tables and figures.<p>a. Exponential smoothing method
Ft+1 = Dt
 + (1 – ) Ft;
where: Ft+1 is the forecast demand for period t+1, is a constant value
used as the smoothing coefficient, and Dt
is the demand during period t.
b. Trend adjusted exponential smoothing method:<br>
At
 = Dt
 + (1 – )(At-1 + Ft-1),<br>
Tt
 = (At
 + At-1) + (1 – ) Tt-1, and<br>

     <div class="head">Exploring New Organizational<br>Knowledge Using Business Intelligence<br>(BI) and Data Mining Techniques
         <br></div><div class="line"></div>
      <p>Another attitude known as exploration seeks to discover new occurrences or
innovative actions for the organization, searching the organization’s past
database. This process involves experiments in the search for new or hidden
information inside the database. It can lead to inconsistent results, but occasionally leads to new courses and important discoveries. Statistical techniques
such as regression and correlation analysis have been traditionally used to
explore new facts or trends.<p>
Business Intelligence (BI), also known as KDD (Knowledge Data Discovery),
technology is applied to suitably related information from different databases
to discover new facts, new relationships, or previously unknown trends. Data<p>mining techniques are used to seek out and discover new relationships and
tendencies (Fayyad et al., 1996; Mena, 1999).
While a DSS is a mean to refine the existing information and data searching for
refined or optimized results, a BI or KDD is a technology used to explore the
data files searching for new knowledge (new information or new relationships
hidden inside the database).
This new type of tool to support decision making is developed due to two main
reasons: the pressure to increase the company’s competitiveness and the desire
to take advantage of the investments already made in information technology.
The search for these objectives is made by organizing data warehouses, which
are new data deposits, suitably joined with the existing database to explore the
benefits offered by Data Mining technology.<p>
The procedures for transforming existing data into new information which
makes it possible to form a new step of decision making are illustrated in Figures

              The term “market basket analysis,” used to designate the algorithm to find new
association rules, has its origin in the problem classifying customers according
to the contents of their market basket or cart.<br>
              <p class="e" >  A Medical Exam Data Set<p><br>
              Let’s analyze a set of data of Table 12.4, corresponding to the results of 14
medical exams reporting the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a certain disease.
The data are fictitious and serve only to illustrate the application of the data-<p>

WEATHER PROBLEM application presented by Witten and Frank (2000).

              A computer program must be used to generate all the potential rules and obtain
their levels of accuracy. It seems clear that only decision rules with 100%
accuracy should be used to form new decision rules, but lower level accuracy
of potential rules is a challenge to proceed with the data-mining process. In this
example, due to the small size of the dataset, it is difficult to generate a new
decision rule with 100% accuracy. However in the Weather Problem data set
presented by Witten and Frank (2000), it is possible to find 58 association
rules with 100% accuracy.<p>

              <p>The main features that distinguish a MIS (Management Information System), a
DSS (Decision Support System), an ES (Expert System), and a KDD
(Knowledge Data Discovery system ) are presented in Table 12.5 ( Turban &

              <p class="b">Case – Using the DSS Forecasting Software Package<p><br>
                    <div class="line"></div>

              Sam Fordson, president of AAA Corporation was meeting with George
Springfield, vice president of operations, to discuss the upcoming budgeting
cycle. George said, “Sam, I’m tired of operations being forced to change
forecast every month. Every fall just before budgeting time, the marketing
people make their annual sales forecast, which, as you know, is updated
monthly. I can tell you that this forecast is merely a composite of all the ‘wish
list’ submitted by the marketing people. After the marketing vice president
receives these forecasts, he simply adds them and adjusts the results to the
situation. I think these procedures for forecasting are too crude, and something
          must be done about them.”</p></div><br>
      
          <div class="first"><p>
Sam replied, “Well George, as you know, the market is very dynamic in our
business and the marketing vice president tries to stay in close touch with the
market. But if you have a better approach to forecasting our monthly demand,
we’ll be happy to give it try.”<p>
George reminded him that the Information Technology people recommend
strongly the use software packages of the corporation’s DSS. The use of the
packages can be made at no additional cost and providing immediate response
to standard questions formulated through the SQL (Structured Query Language) available in the DSS. Forecasting Package and Statistical Analysis
Package are the two most common packages used in business decisions.
George continued, “Perhaps we should test these packages to assist us in
planning the short-term and annual budgets.
              
 <p class="b">Conclusions<p>
              <div class="line"></div>
            The search for new knowledge, inside and outside the organization, exploring
databases, reports, organizational history, patents, professional experience,
etc., is part of the search for organization knowledge. The search for organizational knowledge depends on the availability of an efficient computer system.
An organization’s strategic planning is traditionally based mostly on market
analysis and financial planning. Factors such as indirect costs, customer
satisfaction or preference, usually are not considered in the organization’s
decision strategy due to the difficulty to determine the appropriate information
indicator and range. New software technologies such as theDecision Support
<b>Systems(DSS)</b> and <b>Knowledge Data Discovery</b> (KDD) have been developed as an effort to obtain new knowledge to support decisions in the
organization.<p>
The DSS is an important support for strategic decision making, through
sensibility analysis, known as “what – if?” questions, which allow the examination of new decision alternatives.
Data-mining techniques used inside the KDD environment utilize traditional
statistical and operations research techniques to extract new knowledge, and
new techniques such as Market Basket Analysis to discover new decision rules.
The use of advanced software technologies such as DSS or KDD should
provide important advances in the strategic decision making in the organization
